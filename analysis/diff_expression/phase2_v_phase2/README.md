# Phase 2 vs. Phase 2
Analysis of oysters that experienced both phase 1 and phase 2

## Comparison Info
Investigating **multiple stressors** across **multiple timepoints** in oysters

### Priming vs. No Priming
#### matched stressors
the oyster experienced a repeated stress in phase 2
- **HH vs. CH**
- **WW vs. CW**
- **BB vs. CB**
#### semi-matched stressors
the oyster experienced both a repeated *and* a novel stress in phase 2
- **WB vs. CB**
- **HB vs. CB**

### Single vs. Multiple Stressor Priming ...
#### ...when later exposed to *single* stressors
- **BH vs. HH**
- **BW vs. WW**
#### ...when later exposed to *multiple* stressors
- **HB vs. BB**
- **WB vs. BB**

### Effect of early environment in different contexts
the oyster experienced early exposure to single stress (and so semi-repeated later) or multiple stressors (so exactly repeated later)
