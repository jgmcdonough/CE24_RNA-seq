# Phase 1 vs. Phase 2
Analysis of oysters that only experienced phase 1 compared to those that additionally experienced phase 2

## Comparison Info
Investigating how GE changes **across ontogeny** when additional exposures are experienced
### single stressors
> where S represents a single stressor: warm *or* hypoxia
- **Phase 1 S vs. Phase 2 SC** - effect of early stress environment when returned to control conditions
- **Phase 1 S vs. Phase 2 SS** - how does GE change if experiencing a repeated stressor?
- **Phase 1 S vs. Phase 2 CS** - how does the timing of when a single stressor is experienced change GE? 
### simultaneous stressors
same reasonings/questions as above
- **Phase 1 B vs. Phase 2 BC**
- **Phase 1 B vs. Phase 2 BB**
- **Phase 1 B vs. Phase 2 CB**
### single *and* simultaneous stressors
> where S represents a single stressor: warm *or* hypoxia
- **Phase 1 B vs. Phase 2 BS** - changes in GE if going from simultaneous stressors to later experiencing only one of those stressors
- **Phase 1 S vs. Phase 2 SB** - changes in GE if going from single stressor to later experiencing a repeated stressor *and* a novel stressor
