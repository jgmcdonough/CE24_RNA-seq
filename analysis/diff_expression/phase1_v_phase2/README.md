# Phase 1 vs. Phase 2
Analysis of oysters that only experienced phase 1 compared to those that additionally experienced phase 2

## Comparison Info
Investigating how GE changes *across ontogeny*
- **W vs. WC**
- **H vs. HC**
- **B vs. BC**

See [phase2_v_phase2](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE24_RNA-seq/tree/main/analysis/diff_expression/phase2_v_phase2) to investigate further how GE changes across multiple exposures at two timepoints
