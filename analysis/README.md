# Analysis

Two aspects of analysis:

## [Differential Expression](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE24_RNA-seq/tree/main/analysis/diff_expression)
- using DESeq2 to identify differential expression among treatments and includes downstream analyses

### Comparison Directions
- [**Phase 1 vs. Phase 1**](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE24_RNA-seq/tree/main/analysis/diff_expression/phase1_v_phase1)
- [**Phase 1 vs. Phase 2**](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE24_RNA-seq/tree/main/analysis/diff_expression/phase1_v_phase2)
- [**Phase 2 vs. Phase 2**](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE24_RNA-seq/tree/main/analysis/diff_expression/phase2_v_phase2)

## [Alternative Splicing](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE24_RNA-seq/tree/main/analysis/alt_splicing)
- identifying instances of alternative splicing among treatments
