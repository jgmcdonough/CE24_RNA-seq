# Analysis

Two aspects of analysis:

## [Differential Expression](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE24_RNA-seq/tree/main/analysis/diff_expression)
- using DESeq2 to identify differential expression among treatments and includes downstream analyses

## [Alternative Splicing](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE24_RNA-seq/tree/main/analysis/alt_splicing)
- identifying instances of alternative splicing among treatments
