# Tissue processing

Samples were extracted for RNA (and DNA) using Trizol ([protocol](https://github.com/GWLab-UML/Protocols/blob/main/Molecular_labwork/Trizol%20RNA%20and%20DNA%20Extraction%20Protocol.md))

RNA was DNase treated with the TURBO DNA-free kit from ThermoFisher ([protocol](https://github.com/GWLab-UML/Protocols/blob/main/Molecular_labwork/DNase%20Treatment.md))

#### dnase_treatment.Rmd
R markdown file to determine workflow for dnase treating RNA samples and calculating dilutions.

#### dnase_treat_tracker.csv
CSV file with original RNA sample information (location, concentration) and tracking of dnase treatment
